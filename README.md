## Repository created as part of the "Kodilla Java developer plus" course

Noteworthy are individual projects such as:

### Individual projects

* RPS - Rock paper scissors:
It was the first individual project. The game takes place in the console, you can choose three difficulty levels and play with two additional possibilities:
Spock and lizard. On an easy level, the computer has a 50% chance of losing outright. Hard is the opposite of easy.

* Individual project: Sudoku
My favorite project because I love sudoku :)
The task was to create a sudoku solver and the course created by the program does it. You can also generate random sudokus and solve them.
The user can automatically finish solving the sudoku at any time.

### Kodilla course

Kodilla's course imparts a great deal of knowledge. Each chapter ends with a task to complete.
Unfortunately, each weekly chapter of Kodilla takes me several hours :(
